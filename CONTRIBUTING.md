The goal of this project is to be a pseudo documentary for each subject in question.
Our audience is pointed toward adult readers with little to no knowledge about the subject. "I've heard about Amelia Earhart, but only that she crashed and was never found..."
We want to inject interest in the topic.

If a tall-tail exists about a person, and is important to the person's story, then it can be included in the section. Please Indicate that that portion is likely hear-say or indicate it is with "As legend has it" or other key phrase.
Some of the women in this project may be completely fictional, such as Hua Mulan. Such a story is acceptable if it is important to the society that such a legend is told. An explanation of how you think it changed society is greatly appreciated. 
Some ancient Goddesses and similar may ultimately be addressed under this rule.

Provide links to resources wherever possible; while a description of how you find this subject personally interesting is certainly accepted and imprtant to the reader, the goal often is to inspire further interest of the reader. We want the reader to be left wanting to learn more about our subject and to provide ways to do so.

Length of an article should be between 3 to 10 printed pages (400 words per page, or 200 words and a good picture). If the subject is of incredible importance to you and 10 pages is not enough, that's OK, just make sure the writing is of clear quality beyond that point.

Wikipedia is absolutely fine as a resource, but no copy-paste except for statistics or factual information that can't be reworked.
Images are only acceptable if they are public domain or creative commons or similar license.
Please, no plageurism. I don't want to have to invest in a plageurism detector, this is not a funded project to date.

All writing in this project should be considered open source and in the creative commons with attribution, please feel free to sign your work. 
If this book is ever published on Amazon I would like a way to share the profits with you. In such a case I will try to contact you through github. Amounts would be based on percentage of subjects covered, quality of work, and pages contributed. If instead you would like your share of the profits to go to a charity, please also indicate this near your signature line as such:

Author: Your Name
Charity of choice: MyPreferedCharity.com


Thank you to anyone who choses to contribute to this project.
