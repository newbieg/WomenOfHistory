Ada Lovelace

- Her father was Lord Byron, famous English poet who has social ties to Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. 
- When Ada was 18 years old her math tutor Mary Somerville took her on a summer field trip to meet Charles Babbage, inventor and mathematician. One of his inventions, the difference engine, caught her attention and his blueprints for another machine called the analytical engine caught her imagination. Over time she became close pen-pals with Mr. Babbage who was impressed with her abilities in math. In 1843 she translated an Italian article written by Luigi Federico into English, but she added notes to the pages about the engine, and her own notes were longer than the original writing. In some of the notes that she wrote, she demonstrated how to write a program that would run on the engine. She is therefore the first person to publish a computer program. She is the world's first computer programmer.
- Died 94 years before the Eniac (The first electrical computer).
- First to consider that a machine that could calculate arbitrary numbers could also be used to represent real-world entities and ideas.
- Adamantly defended Babbages' Analytical Engine and expressed its advances over other calculating machines of the time.
